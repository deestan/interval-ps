Programming Test

Make a program in your favorite language/environment that takes two inputs:
•	a set of include intervals
•	a set of exclude intervals

The sets of intervals can be given in any order, and they may be empty or overlapping

The program should output the result of taking all the includes and “remove” the excludes.

The output should be given as non-overlapping intervals in a sorted order.

Intervals will contain Integers only.

Example 1:

Includes: 10-100
Excludes: 20-30

Output should be: 10-19, 31-100

Example 2:
Includes: 50-5000, 10-100
Excludes: (none)
Output: 10-5000

Example 3:
Includes: 10-100, 200-300
Excludes: 95-205
Output: 10-94,206-300

Example 4:
Includes: 10-100, 200-300, 400-500
Excludes: 95-205, 410-420
Output: 10-94, 206-300, 400-409, 421-500

Things we will look for in the evaluation of this test:
•	Does the program work as described in the specification? Is it bug-free?
•	The overall design of your solution. 
•	Is the code easy to read and maintain?
•	What is the complexity of your algorithm? (Big-O notation)
